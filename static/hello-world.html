        <p class="droplet-text">I've been trying to learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> on and off for the least year or so, although I tend to put these projects down for months at a time. Recenly, I've put a bit more time into <a href="https://github.com/zthart/spindrift">Spindrift</a>, a basic static site generator designed for simple blogs like this one! The basic building block in Spindrift is a <em>droplet</em> - which is a single post written in YAML. These posts can contain basic metadata about the post, such as author and date, and either an image, text content, or both.</p>
<p class="droplet-text">Currently, spindrift supports basic markdown formatting (<strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em>, and <a href="#">links</a>), but lacks support for things like ordered/unordered lists, code blocks or preformatted text, or different heading types within posts. These are all on my roadmap to work on, and I may end up just relying on some pre-existing rust libraries for markdown support. At the moment, however, this markdown parsing is implemented in plain regex.</p>
<p class="droplet-text">I have a laundry list of features that it would be nice to work on, but who knows what will get done. For now though, I'm happy to have a working "beta" of sorts. Check out this and my other projects <em><a href="https://github.com/zthart">on GitHub</a></em>!</p>
