        <p class="droplet-text">A critical security feature of any code that exists online (or exists to generate content for the web) is to avoid interpreting unsanitized user input as code. Code injection like this is some of the lowest hanging fruit for bad actors.</p>
<p class="droplet-text">Spindrift could, in theory, be used as a vector to run malicious or potentially deceptive code on the machines of your blogs viewers. For example, say that an attacker gains root access to a machine on which your ssh private key is held, and copies this key to their personal machine. This key is already present on your github account, and now the attacker has full push access to your github repositories. If you aren't keeping a close eye on your repo, the attacker may be able to push a commit without you noticing for some time. The attacker alters a droplet by including a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag that embeds some javascript into the page. If unescaped this javascript will be interpreted and run on any viewers browser.</p>
<p class="droplet-text">The impact of this could be anything from an adversary adding a tracker to your page, or even changing content in such a way that users from your general location using the Geolocation API will see your intended content (so that when you visit your own site you notice nothing amiss), while users from other areas see something offensive or damaging.</p>
<p class="droplet-text">Obviously, if a user has full write access to your github repositories, abusing code injection in spindrift is likely one of the more tame things they could do, but at the very least we can make it a point to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p class="droplet-text"><strong>This all to say</strong>, spindrift now escapes the <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>&amp;</code> html entities -- as well as supporting markdown syntax for in-line code! Just wrap your code with one (or more!) <code>&grave;</code>. (To wrap single <code>&grave;</code> in inline-code, escape the central single <code>&grave;</code> - like this <code>&grave;\&grave;&grave;</code>)</p>
